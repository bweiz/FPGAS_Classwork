# Final project proposal

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Hardware: Push Button
Software: Pressing the push button cycles through a wide range of preset colors on the RGB LED.

## Hardware/software proposal 2
Hardware: LED Array
Software: The LED Array displays the number of processes currently running in linux.

## Combined proposal
The push button will cycle between different colors on the RGB LED before returning control to the potentiometers. The LED array will constanty display the amount of processes running in Linux in binary.
